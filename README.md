# Lunaph
A small language recorder.

## How to use

After executing the .py file, you will see the prompt "> ", where you can input the operations below.

### pos | â€œadd -p"

By inputting "pos" or "add -p", you can set some parts of speech. You may input a full name (e.g. "noun") after the prompt "pos> " and input a abbreviation (e.g. "n") after the prompt "abbr> ". There is also a complex mode to add new parts of speech. Input "pos -a" or "add -p -a" or "add -a -p" at the beginning and you can set the type pattern ("pat> ") and more information ("info> ") after inputting the part of speech and its abbreviation. If you want to skip one of the processes, just press enter at the corresponding prompt.

The type pattern of a part of speech is a regular expression that the words must match. For instance, the word "viro" matches the regular expression "o$" or ".*o$" et cetera.

If your word doesn't match the enforced pattern of your part of speech, you can override the lexical rules by inputting "y".

## About the name "Lunaph"

The word "lunaph" comes from Ai Rael (which is one of my constructed languages). It derives from "lw'nafh", which means "dream" in Cthuvian. The meaning of this word hasn't changed much throughout the history. I set this particular name for this project because it is one of my unrealistic dreams.
