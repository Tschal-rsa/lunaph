A small language recorder.

**Note that Python module** *pyecharts* **is required** (to generate etymology trees).

## About the name "Lunaph"

The word "lunaph" comes from Ai Rael (which is one of my constructed languages). It derives from "lw'nafh", which means "dream" in Cthuvian. The meaning of this word hasn't changed much throughout the history. I set this particular name for this project because it is one of my unrealistic dreams.
